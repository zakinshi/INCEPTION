# Inception

**Inception** is a system administration and DevOps project from 42 School. It involves setting up a full web infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. The project includes WordPress, a MariaDB database, NGINX, and various Docker services with secure configuration and automation.

## üß± Project Overview

This project consists of building a scalable and secure web server using **Docker** containers and **Docker Compose**. Each essential service runs in its own container:

- **NGINX**: Web server with SSL (TLS) support via self-signed certificates
- **WordPress**: CMS running on PHP-FPM
- **MariaDB**: MySQL-compatible database for WordPress
- **File Structure**: Data is persisted using Docker volumes
